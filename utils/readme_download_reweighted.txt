REWEIGHTED/ contains the results of reweighting the CALVADOS2 simulation against SAXS data
- saxs.dat: Experimental SAXS intensities and calculated averaged SAXS profiles (both before and after reweighted); errors of experimental SAXS intensities are BIFT-corrected
- reweighted_conf_properties.csv: SAXS-reweighted ensemble averaged conformational properties
- reweighted_scaling_profile.dat: SAXS-reweighted scaling profile
