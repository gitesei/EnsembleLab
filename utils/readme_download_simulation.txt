SIMULATION/ contains the results of the CALVADOS simulation of the provided sequence
- seq.fasta: user-provided IDP sequence
- env_settings.txt: user-chosen settings for MD (temperature, ionic strength, pH)
- top.pdb: pdb representative of the topology of the coarse-grained model
- traj.xtc: centered and PBC-solved trajectory of the coarse-grained MD simulation
- top_AA.pdb: pdb representative of the topology of the all-atom model
- traj_AA.dcd: centered and PBC-solved trajectory of the MD simulations converted to all-atom. NB: steric clashes might be present and interactions involving side-chains should not be trusted.
- traj.log: log file of the MD simulation
- conf_properties.csv: ensemble averaged conformational properties calculated from the MD simulation
- energy_map.csv: energy maps calculated using the non-ionic Ashbaugh-Hatch potential of the CALVADOS model
- time_series_Rg_Ree_Delta_S.csv: time series of Rg, Ree, Delta, and S
- scaling_profile.csv: scaling profile (average distance for each pair of residue |i-j| apart)
